## Why FilaOps?

Most ERP systems are built for traditional manufacturing. They don't understand filament spools, print times, multi-material jobs, or why you need to track which roll went into which print.

FilaOps was built by someone who runs a print farm and got tired of spreadsheets and generic software that didn't fit.

**What makes it different:**
- **3D printing native** - BOMs that understand filament, print times, and material costs
- **Actually usable** - Docker setup, dark theme UI, no enterprise sales calls required
- **Self-hosted & open** - Your data stays yours. No cloud dependency, no vendor lock-in
- **Production-grade** - Serial/lot traceability ready for medical device and aerospace compliance

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blb3D/filaops.git
cd filaops
docker-compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:5173 — the **Setup Wizard** will guide you through creating your admin account.

That's it. Database, API, and UI are all pre-configured.

📖 **[Full Installation Guide](INSTALL.md)** for manual setup or troubleshooting.

> **Note for developers:** There's also a `docker-compose.dev.yml` file for local development. End users should use `docker-compose.yml` (the default).

## ⚙️ Build Configuration (Community Edition)

The community version uses **development mode builds** for the frontend to maximize debuggability and contributor experience:

- ✅ **Unminified code** - Easy to debug and understand
- ✅ **Source maps included** - Full stack traces with real line numbers
- ✅ **Readable variable names** - Contributing PRs is easier
- ⚠️ **Larger bundle size** (~2MB vs ~1MB minified)

**This is intentional for self-hosted deployments** where source code is already visible and performance impact is negligible on local networks.

> 📝 **For SaaS/Production hosting:** Production builds require refactoring ~30 components to fix React hook timing issues. See `frontend/PRODUCTION_BUILD_BLOCKED.md` for details. This only affects public-facing deployments; self-hosted users are unaffected.
