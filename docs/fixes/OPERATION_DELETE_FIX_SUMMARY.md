# BOM Operations Delete Functionality - Implementation Summary

## Issue
Users were unable to remove operations from a BOM routing once saved. The UI only allowed removing "pending" operations (not yet saved), but provided no way to delete operations that had been saved to the database.

## Root Cause
The `AdminBOM.jsx` component was missing:
1. Handler function to call the backend DELETE API endpoint
2. "Actions" column in the operations table
3. Delete button for saved operations

## Backend API
The backend already had the required DELETE endpoint:
- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/v1/routings/operations/{operation_id}`
- **Location**: `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/routings.py` (lines 760-783)
- **Functionality**: Soft delete (sets `is_active = False`) and recalculates routing totals

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Delete Handler Function
Added `handleDeleteOperation` function that:
- Shows confirmation dialog before deletion
- Calls the DELETE API endpoint
- Refreshes routing data after successful deletion
- Displays appropriate toast notifications

### 2. Added "Actions" Column to Table Header
Added a new column header for actions in the operations table.

### 3. Added Delete Button to Each Operation Row
Added a remove button in each operation row with:
- Red color scheme (destructive action)
- Hover effects
- Confirmation dialog
- Toast notifications

## Features
✅ **Confirmation Dialog**: Prevents accidental deletions  
✅ **User Feedback**: Toast notifications for success/error states  
✅ **Auto Refresh**: Routing data refreshes after deletion  
✅ **Consistent Styling**: Matches existing UI patterns  
✅ **Accessibility**: Button has title attribute for tooltip  
✅ **Error Handling**: Handles network failures and API errors  

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before
- ✅ Could remove **pending** operations (not yet saved)
- ❌ Could NOT remove **saved** operations
- ❌ Only workaround: Delete entire routing and recreate

### After
- ✅ Can remove **pending** operations (unchanged)
- ✅ Can remove **saved** operations (NEW)
- ✅ Individual operation management

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminBOM.jsx`
  - Added `handleDeleteOperation` function (~35 lines)
  - Added "Actions" column header
  - Added delete button cell in operations table

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Users can now fully manage routing operations without recreating entire routings
- **Data Integrity**: Uses soft delete (backend sets `is_active = False`)
- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes, only added functionality
- **Performance**: Minimal impact, single DELETE request + routing refresh

## Testing Recommendations
1. Delete single operation - verify removal and refresh
2. Cancel deletion dialog - verify no changes
3. Delete multiple operations - verify each deletion works
4. Test error handling with network offline
5. Verify UI elements display correctly
6. Regression test: verify editing times still works

## Future Enhancements
1. Update RoutingEditor to use similar immediate DELETE approach
2. Add bulk delete functionality
3. Add drag-and-drop resequencing
4. Add undo functionality
