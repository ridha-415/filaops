"""
Backfill received_date for Purchase Orders

This script fixes POs that have 'received' or 'closed' status but NULL received_date.
These were likely created before the received_date field was properly populated.

The script will:
1. Find all POs with status 'received' or 'closed' and NULL received_date
2. Set received_date to:
   - expected_date if available
   - order_date if no expected_date
   - updated_at date as last resort
