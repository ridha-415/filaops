Create Date: 2025-12-09

This is a baseline migration that stamps the existing database state.
No actual changes are made - this just marks the database as being at
a known point in the migration history.

The actual schema was created via SQLAlchemy's create_all() and manual migrations.
Future migrations will track changes from this point forward.
