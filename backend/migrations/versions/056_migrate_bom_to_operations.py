"""
Migrate BOM lines to routing operation materials.

This migration consolidates the legacy bom_lines table data into the
routing_operation_materials table, which is the new unified approach.

Migration Strategy:
- consume_stage='production' -> First production operation (or sequence 1)
- consume_stage='shipping' -> Shipping/pack operation (if found), else last operation

After this migration, the bom_lines table data is preserved (not deleted)
but should no longer be used. The UI will be updated to hide the BOM tab.
