## What's New?

### 🆕 New Features

**Activity Timeline** - You can now see a visual timeline of order events right on the order detail page. Track when orders were created, confirmed, shipped, and completed.

**Work Centers & Machines** - Manage your production resources like 3D printer pools and assembly stations. This lays the foundation for production scheduling.

**Better Testing** - Comprehensive E2E test suite to catch bugs before they affect you.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

We fixed some important bugs:
- **Purchasing page crash** - Fixed the TypeError that was crashing the low-stock calculation
- **Payment validation** - No more 6-digit years! Payments are now validated properly
- **Security** - Production deployments now fail if you're using the default SECRET_KEY

### 🔧 Under the Hood

- SQL Server compatibility improvements (66 files updated)
- Better error messages throughout
- Type hints for better IDE support
- Removed JWT tokens from git tracking (security improvement)

## ⚠️ Important: Database Migrations

v1.5.0 adds **3 new database migrations** for work centers, machines, and fulfillment tracking.

**You MUST run this after upgrading:**

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec backend alembic upgrade head
```

Don't worry - these migrations are **additive only**. Your existing data is safe.
