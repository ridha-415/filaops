3. **Restart**: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`

## Common Support Responses

### "Containers won't start"
```
Check if something's using port 5174:
Windows: `netstat -ano | findstr :5174`
Linux/Mac: `lsof -i :5174`

Or try removing volumes and restarting:
`docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down -v`
`docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`
```

### "Getting JavaScript errors"
```
Clear your browser cache! The frontend was updated.
- Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
- Or use incognito mode
```

### "Migration failed"
```
Check the migration status:
`docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec backend alembic current`

Can you share the error message? That'll help us troubleshoot!
```

### "Do I need to backup?"
```
The migrations are additive only (no data loss), but it's always smart to backup before upgrading. Quick backup:

**Using Docker volumes**: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec db ... backup command`
**Using SQL Server Management Studio**: Right-click database → Tasks → Backup

You should be fine without it, but better safe than sorry!
```
